# Restmock

[![Build Status](http://ci.buildria.com/job/restmock/badge/icon)](http://ci.buildria.com/job/restmock/)

Restmock is a test framework  which is inspired by [Restito](https://github.com/mkotsur/restito).

Restmock provides a DSL to:

 * Mimic rest server behavior
 * Record HTTP calls to the server
 * Perform verification against happened calls (TODO)
